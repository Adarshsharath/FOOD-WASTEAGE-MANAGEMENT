## Tips & Best Practices

### 1. **Use Auto-Generated IDs**
- The system suggests the next available ID
- This prevents duplicate ID errors
- You can still use custom IDs if needed

### 2. **Fill Required Fields**
- Fields marked as required must be filled
- The system will show validation errors if you miss any

### 3. **Check Dependencies**
- Add providers before adding listings
- Add receivers before creating claims
- Add listings before creating claims

### 4. **Monitor Expiry Dates**
- Items near expiry are highlighted in red on the dashboard
- Check the "Food listings near expiry" query regularly

### 5. **Export Data Regularly**
- Use the Admin page to backup your data
- Export important contact lists from Providers & Receivers page

### 6. **Use Filters**
- On the dashboard, use filters to find specific items
- Filter by city, food type, or meal type
