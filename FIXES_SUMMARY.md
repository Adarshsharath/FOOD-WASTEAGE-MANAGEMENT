2. **Test Add Listing:**
   - Try adding a listing with the suggested ID
   - Try adding a listing with a custom ID
   - Try adding a duplicate ID (should show error)
   - Try submitting with empty required fields (should show validation errors)

3. **Test Add Claim:**
   - Try adding a claim with the suggested ID
   - Try adding a claim with a duplicate ID (should show error)
