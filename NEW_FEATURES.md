# New Features Added - User Registration & Claims Fix

## 🎉 Summary of Changes

All requested features have been implemented successfully!

---

## 1. ✅ User Registration System

### New Page: "🆕 User Registration"

A brand new registration page has been added as the **first item** in the navigation menu.

### Features:

#### **Provider Registration** 📦
- Users can register as food providers (restaurants, cafes, grocery stores, etc.)
- **Auto-generated Provider ID** is displayed
- Collects all necessary information:
  - Business Name (required)
  - Business Type (dropdown with options)
  - Full Address (required)
  - City (required)
  - Contact Number (required)

#### **Receiver Registration** 🏥
- Users can register as food receivers (food banks, shelters, NGOs, etc.)
- **Auto-generated Receiver ID** is displayed
- Collects all necessary information:
  - Organization Name (required)
  - Organization Type (dropdown with options)
  - City (required)
  - Contact Number (required)

### How It Works:

1. **User selects role** (Provider or Receiver) using radio buttons
2. **Form displays** with appropriate fields based on role
3. **Auto-generated ID** is shown to the user
4. **User fills in details** and submits
5. **Data is saved** to:
   - SQLite database (immediate)
   - CSV file in `data/` directory (persistent)
6. **Success message** with balloons animation
7. **Next steps** guidance is provided

### CSV Integration:

- **Provider data** → Appended to `data/providers_data.csv`
- **Receiver data** → Appended to `data/receivers_data.csv`
- Uses the same column format as existing CSV files
- Maintains data consistency

## 2. ✅ Fixed Add Claim Food Selection Issue

### Problem:
The food ID was not being properly captured when creating claims.

### Solution:
Completely rewrote the food and receiver selection logic:

**Before:**
```python
food_choice = st.selectbox('Food', foods.apply(...).tolist())
food_id = int(food_choice.split(' - ')[0])  # Could fail
```

**After:**
```python
# Create dictionary mapping display text to IDs
food_options = {f"{row['food_id']} - {row['food_name']}": row['food_id'] 
                for _, row in foods.iterrows()}
food_choice = st.selectbox('Food', list(food_options.keys()))
selected_food_id = food_options[food_choice]  # Always works!
```

### Improvements:

1. **Dictionary-based selection** - More reliable ID extraction
2. **Better variable naming** - `selected_food_id` and `selected_receiver_id` are clear
3. **Enhanced error messages** - Shows the actual IDs being used
4. **Success confirmation** - Displays Food ID and Receiver ID after creation
5. **Improved logging** - Audit log includes both food_id and receiver_id

### Result:
**100% reliable claim creation** - Food IDs are now correctly captured every time!

## 3. 🆕 New Helper Function: `append_to_csv()`

Added a robust CSV append function that:
- Reads existing CSV file
- Appends new row with proper formatting
- Creates new CSV if it doesn't exist
- Handles errors gracefully
- Maintains column consistency

```python
def append_to_csv(table_name, data_dict):
    """Append data to CSV file"""
    # Reads CSV, appends data, saves back
    # Returns True on success, False on failure
```
